## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Image component no longer converts SVGs to WebP — SVGs are now served as-is.
- Button component no longer relies on `display: contents` on its root wrapper.
- Definition list items no longer rely on `display: contents` on their root wrapper.
- Content selector items now use camelCase `iconName` and `subText` fields for optional icons and supporting text.
- Heading icons now stay inline with heading text so titles wrap naturally after the icon.
