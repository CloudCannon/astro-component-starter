          I almost forgot that website maintenance was a thing.


          That's something you just don't need to do when you have this static
          tech stack.

          No more forced updates, database patches, or security monitoring.
          CloudCannon’s static architecture eliminates the maintenance treadmill
          that consumes development time. While WordPress sites need constant
          attention, your CloudCannon sites just run — leaving your team free to
          build new features instead of babysitting old ones.

        heading: New site? No problem.
        subtitle: >-
          Spin up new sites in minutes, not weeks. CloudCannon’s template system
          and reusable components mean you’re not starting from scratch every
          time. Whether it’s a product launch, regional site, or client project,
          you can deploy new sites faster than other teams can plan theirs.

          CloudCannon’s hosting infrastructure handles traffic spikes
          automatically while static architecture eliminates the security
          vulnerabilities that plague database-driven sites. No 3am server
          alerts, no emergency patches — just reliable hosting that works.

          The ability to manage all our websites from one central location has
          eliminated so much complexity.


          Our team can focus on creating great content instead of wrestling with
          multiple content management systems and technical barriers.
